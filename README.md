# Mushroom-NN-Architecture-Comparison

## Project Overview
This project explores various neural network architectures to classify mushrooms as either edible ('e') or poisonous ('p') using the [UCI Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom). The primary focus is on comparing model complexity and determining the optimal architecture for this classification task.

## Objectives
- Implement three different neural network architectures with varying complexity
- Compare model performance using cross-validation techniques
- Determine the best-performing architecture based on validation metrics
- Evaluate the winning model on a separate test dataset

## Implementation Details
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Validation**: scikit-learn cross-validation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Documentation**: Detailed analysis of architecture comparison including loss functions, activation functions, and hyperparameters

## Results
The repository includes detailed analysis of three different neural network architectures, their performance metrics, and a final recommendation on the optimal model for mushroom classification.
